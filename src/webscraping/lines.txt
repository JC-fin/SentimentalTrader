Proshares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil (NYSE:UCO)
Class Period : March 6, 2020 - April 27, 2020
The filed complaint alleges that defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) decreased demand for oil due to the coronavirus pandemic and increased oil supply and diminished oil prices caused by the Russia/Saudi oil price war had caused extraordinary market volatility
 (2) a massive influx of investor capital into the Fund, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, in a matter of days had increased Fund inefficiencies, heightened illiquidity in the West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") futures contract markets in which the Fund invested, and caused the Fund to approach positional and regulatory limits (adverse trends exacerbated by the Offering itself)
 (3) there was a sharp divergence between spot and future prices in the WTI oil markets, leading to a super contango market dynamic as oil storage space in Cushing, Oklahoma dwindled and was insufficient to account for the excess supply expected to be delivered pursuant to the WTI May 2020 futures contract
 As a result, UCO could not continue to pursue the passive investment strategy represented in the Registration Statement, causing its results to significantly deviate from its purported benchmark

Nano-X Imaging Ltd
 (NASDAQ:NNOX)
Class Period : August 21, 2020 - September 15, 2020
The filed complaint alleges that defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Nano-X's commercial agreements and its customers were fabricated
 (2) Nano-X's statements regarding its "novel" Nanox System were misleading as the Company never provided data comparing its images with images from competitors' machines
 (3) Nano-X's submission to the U
S
 Food and Drug Administration admitted the Nanox System was not original
 and (4) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times

Nikola Corporation, f/k/a VectoIQ Acquisition Corp
 (NASDAQ:NKLA)
Class Period : March 3, 2020 - September 15, 2020
The filed complaint alleges that defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) VectoIQ did not engage in proper due diligence regarding its merger with Nikola
 (2) Nikola overstated its "in-house" design, manufacturing, and testing capabilities
 (3) Nikola overstated its hydrogen production capabilities
 (4) as a result, Nikola overstated its ability to lower the cost of hydrogen fuel
 (5) Nikola founder and Executive Chairman, Trevor Milton, tweeted a misleading "test" video of the Company's Nikola Two truck
 (6) the work experience and background of key Nikola employees, including Mr
 Milton, had been overstated and obfuscated
 (7) Nikola did not have five Tre trucks completed
 and (8) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times

Out on Wall Street, elections are the talk of the town
 As President Trump’s battle against COVID-19 wages on, Biden has taken the lead in the race to the White House, with a Reuters poll conducted on October 2-3 putting the former Vice President ahead by 10 percentage points
 Against this backdrop, fears of a blue wave (a Democrat-controlled presidency, Senate and House) are washing onto the Street
 However, Goldman Sachs believes a blue wave might not be such a bad thing for the U
S
 economy
 “All else equal, such a blue wave would likely prompt us to upgrade our forecasts
 The reason is that it would sharply raise the probability of a fiscal stimulus package of at least $2 trillion shortly after the presidential inauguration on January 20, followed by longer-term spending increases on infrastructure, climate, health care and education that would at least match the likely longer-term tax increases on corporations and upper-income earners,” Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius noted
  Bearing this in mind, our focus shifted to two stocks flagged by Goldman Sachs as strong value plays
 Running both tickers through TipRanks’ database, we found out what makes each so compelling
 General Electric (GE) First up we have General Electric, which has been a pioneer in the transportation, power, environmental and healthcare industries for the last 150 years
 According to Goldman Sachs, the future looks bright for this name
 Firm analyst Joe Ritchie tells clients that in the two years since Larry Culp took over as CEO, the company has placed a significant focus on becoming a “leaner, structurally more productive company with better capital discipline
”  “While the pandemic has caused delays in the transformation, we believe GE will emerge as a stronger company
 Admittedly, we might be a little early on the turn in the stock, but we believe we are at a bottom from both a fundamental and sentiment perspective, and that is typically the best time to own industrial cyclicals
 Our base case assumption is that a vaccine will be mass distributed over the next 12 months and, under this scenario, we believe the second derivative improvement on the resumption of air travel will be significant and many of the underlying concerns on GE’s balance sheet will fall to the background,” Ritchie explained
  To this end, the analyst thinks HSD industrial free cash flow margins could be achieved by 2023
 However, these expectations could be conservative should commercial aerospace rebound more quickly than Ritchie anticipates
  “In the near-term, we believe Industrial FCF bottomed in 1H20 and think GE could generate $1 billion-plus in 2H20 given close to $2 billion in 2H cash actions, high margin outages that were pushed from 1H to 2H, a lower drag from onshore wind installations given the PTC was extended to 2021 and a good recovery in PDx
 As a result, we think 2H Industrial FCF could likely surprise to the upside, a potential positive near-term catalyst for the shares,” Ritchie commented
  It should be noted that aviation has been GE’s crown jewel segment, but this sector has been hampered by the pandemic as well as two fatal Boeing 737-Max crashes
 That said, Goldman Sachs’ global Aerospace team expects commercial AM trends to return to 2019 levels by 2023
 Ritchie added, “We estimate there could be an additional $1
3 billion to our Aviation 2023 EBIT forecast if commercial aftermarket were to rebound to 2019 levels by 2023
” On top of this, the Renewables and Power segments could drive upside for GE
 “While the COVID-19 pandemic hurt Gas Power demand, we believe the self-help story is firmly in place but still discount management’s expectations for HSD margins in Gas Power in 2021 and we don’t expect Renewables to turn EBIT positive until 2022,” Ritchie mentioned
  In line with his optimistic approach, Ritchie stayed with the bulls, reinstating a Buy rating with a $10 price target
 Investors could be pocketing a gain of 46%, should this target be met in the twelve months ahead
 (To watch Ritchie’s track record, click here) Turning to the rest of the Street, opinions are split evenly
 With 6 Buys and 6 Holds assigned in the last three months, the word on the Street is that GE is a Moderate Buy
 At $8
20, the average price target implies 20% upside potential
 (See General Electric stock analysis on TipRanks) Translate Bio (TBIO) Developing a new class of potentially transformative medicines using messenger RNA (mRNA), Translate Bio hopes to bring new treatments to market for diseases caused by protein or gene dysfunction
 Based on its promising technology, it’s no wonder Goldman Sachs is pounding the table
  Writing for the firm, analyst Terence Flynn points to its lead candidate, MRT5005, a codon-optimized human CFTR mRNA, which is formulated in lipid nanoparticles that are delivered via a nebulizer, as a key component of his bullish thesis
 The therapy is currently progressing through a Phase 1/2 cystic fibrosis (CF) trial
  Looking at early clinical data, the asset generated an initial signal of clinical activity
 That being said, while an improvement in lung function was witnessed, the results aren’t definitive
 Despite the early nature of the data, Flynn sees the next data readout, which is slated for 2021, as a major possible catalyst
 “For MRT5005 we see the most straightforward path to market and unmet need being the ~10% of CF patients with splice mutations where Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX)’s drugs are not effective, which we project could be a ~$1
9 billion peak opportunity,” he commented
 VRTX has developed several oral drugs called CF correctors or potentiators, that when used in combination improve the function of the existing CFTR protein in the majority of CF patients and thus, drive improved outcomes, which has made them the standard of care
 However, these therapies only work in patients with at least one F508del mutation, which represents roughly 90% of patients with CF
 For the other 10% of CF patients whose bodies don't make the CFTR protein, the drugs don’t have anything to target
 The analyst added, “TBIO believes there is also significant unmet need beyond this ~10% of CF patients, including an incremental ~20% of patients that either have a suboptimal lung function (FEV1) response to VRTX’s drugs or cannot tolerate them
” If that wasn’t enough, TBIO is collaborating with Sanofi-Aventis on a COVID-19 vaccine, which could make its way to the clinic later this year
 To this end, data could come by 1H21
 “However, PFE/BNTX’s upcoming Phase 2/3 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine data will likely represent one of the first definitive readouts on vaccine efficacy and safety (in addition to MRNA and AZN) and in our view, there are three likely outcomes, which also have implications for TBIO,” Flynn stated
 As part of this collaboration, the companies are also advancing preclinical development vaccine programs against several other targets including influenza, viral pathogens and bacterial pathogens
  What’s more, Flynn argues that TBIO represents a possible M&A target as “the company has a novel platform technology (mRNA), a wholly owned clinical stage asset (MRT5005), and a broad partnership covering mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases, which could become de-risked over the near to medium-term
” Given all of the above, Flynn sides with the bulls
 To kick off his coverage, he puts a Buy rating and $19 price target on the stock
 This target brings the upside potential to 29%
 (To watch Flynn’s track record, click here) Are other analysts in agreement? They are
 Only Buy ratings, 5 to be exact, have been issued in the last three months
 Therefore, the message is clear: TBIO is a Strong Buy
 The $27
50 average price target suggests shares could climb 87% higher in the next year

Which stocks are always on investors’ wish lists? Growth stocks
 Time and time again, the pros on the Street point to tickers with above-average growth prospects as must-haves, as they stand to deliver major rewards in the long run
  We really aren’t joking when we say above-average
 Stocks that fall into this category have already notched impressive gains year-to-date, but this is only the beginning
 The wins could keep on coming through 2020 and beyond
  Having a target in mind is one thing, but how exactly are investors supposed to track down these names? This is where TipRanks can come in handy
 Using TipRanks’ database, we scanned the Street for analyst-approved stocks that have exhibited a stellar run-up in 2020, and are poised to climb higher in the year ahead
 Here are all of the details
  Stamps
com (STMP) Providing online mailing and shipping services, Stamps
com makes it easy for its customers to print U
S
 Postal Service-approved postage
 Even though shares have already jumped 215% year-to-date, some analysts think this name has more room to run
 After a recent conversation with management, National Research's Allen Klee has high hopes for STMP
 The analyst tells clients his primary takeaway was “Stamps
com is positioned to benefit from accelerating ecommerce demand
” What’s more, he believes the deep functionality, integration, carrier relationships and processing speed of its products give it a leg up
 When it comes to STMP’s revenue, 80% comes from shipping, which makes it “levered to positive ecommerce trends,” in Klee’s opinion
 He noted, “We would expect shipping to increase as a percent of total revenue over time
 In addition, the company will get international growth and potential market share gains, in our view
” Klee added, “The company has improved their growth outlook and lowered their risk profile through expanding their offerings and services, investing internationally and diversifying carrier relationships
” These investments are related to technology for MetaPack and ShipStation, two companies it acquired, and ShipEngines, its multi-carrier shipping platform
 When the spending on these areas of the business moderates, the analyst thinks STMP’s already strong margins will get a boost
 Along with the fact that STMP doesn’t have large exposure to any one sector, Klee argues its new partnership with UPS presents an exciting long-term opportunity
 “As Stamps
com has eliminated its exclusivity with USPS, they are at various stages of negotiations with various carriers,” he mentioned
 The company’s guidance for 2020 does assume a decline in 2H20 compared to the first half of the year, but this is related to how much of the spike in ecommerce demand witnessed in Q2 2020 is sustainable and the impact of the weak macro environment
  That being said, Klee highlights new data on customer adds that is “of comparable quality” to past data
 Additionally, according to the analyst, “positive data points come from FedEx’s August 2020 quarterly revenues being up 11% from the prior May 2020 quarter and Pitney Bowes on their Q2 2020 earnings call guiding for their global ecommerce segment revenues in Q3 2020 to be comparable to levels from Q2 2020
” The fourth quarter is also historically the strongest quarter for ecommerce given holiday sales
 As for competition in the space, Amazon is turning into a major player
 With the giant posing a threat to other carriers, Klee thinks STMP can help those that want to improve their offerings
 Everything that STMP has going for it convinced Klee to leave his Buy rating as is
 Along with the call, he keeps the price target at $390, suggesting 48% upside potential
 (To watch Klee’s track record, click here) Looking at the consensus breakdown, 2 Buys and 1 Hold have been issued in the last three months
 Therefore, STMP gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating
 Based on the $336
67 average price target, shares could surge 28% in the next year

com stock analysis on TipRanks) Farfetch (FTCH) On to another name that could benefit from accelerating ecommerce trends, Farfetch is an online luxury fashion retail platform that sells products from boutiques and brands from around the world
 Up 157% year-to-date, several members of the Street believe this name is still heating up
 Writing for J
P
 Morgan, five-star analyst Doug Anmuth tells clients that amid broader weakness in the space, “Farfetch stands out as a more valuable and differentiated partner
”  Expounding on this, Anmuth commented, “We believe Farfetch became an increasingly important partner to boutiques, brands, and other retail partners during the height of COVID-19 as many physical stores closed and even some online competitors were unable to ship from their distribution centers
 For many partners, Farfetch was the only way they could generate sales during the pandemic
” As a result of this, boutiques, brands and department stores added more inventory to the Marketplace (MP), as well as increased reliance on Farfetch Platform Solutions (FPS)
 This is evidenced by its earnings results for Q2 2020
 During the quarter, the acceleration of the secular shift fueled Digital Platform gross merchandise value (GMV) of $651 million, up 34% year-over-year and above the recently revised expectation of $605-$630 million
 Additionally, FTCH saw record-high in-season stock levels, with 380,000 stock keeping units across 3,500 brands, from 1,300 sellers including 500 direct brand e-concessions
 There was a 60% increase in traffic and a doubling of app installs in Q2, leading to the addition of 500,000 new customers
 Anmuth also noted, “With direct brand e-concessions (EC) at 50%-plus of all inventory in the MP, the top 20 direct EC brands doubled their sales year-over-year
” Looking ahead, management expects Digital Platform GMV to ramp up to 40-45% growth in Q3, thanks to the early recovery in China, Western Europe and the Middle East, as well as a late Q2 pick-up in the U
S
 On top of this, a number of key initiatives could propel the company forward, in Anmuth’s opinion
 New Guards Group (NGG), which has been controversial among investors, drove $66 million in brand platform revenue and GMV, even though there were some delays in Fall-Winter shipments as retailers worked through Spring-Summer inventory
 Off-White is cited as another point of strength, with the launch of Harrods also benefiting FTCH
  To sum it all up, Anmuth said, “Overall, we recognize that FTCH benefited from a favorable environment with multi-year acceleration of luxury ecommerce adoption
 But we expect trends to remain elevated as consumers increasingly value the ease and convenience of FTCH's platform, and brands and boutiques add greater inventory
 We think FTCH is better positioned than any time since its IPO having made significant strides in direct brand e-concessions and adding selection from NGG, while also showing greater cost discipline and commitment to EBITDA profit in 2021
” Based on all of the above, Anmuth stayed with the bulls, reiterating an Overweight rating and $40 price target
 Investors could be pocketing a gain of 50%, should this target be met in the twelve months ahead
 (To watch Anmuth’s track record, click here) Turning to the rest of the Street, the bulls have it on this one
 With 8 Buys, 1 Hold and 1 Sell, the word on the Street is that FTCH is a Moderate Buy
 At $31
70, the average price target implies 19% upside potential
